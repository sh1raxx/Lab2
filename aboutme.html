    <!-- A lot of typing :D Maybe put somemthing here to make it easy to read?-->
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> I was born in Astana, Kazakhstan and im 18 y.o. Ever since childhood, I've been captivated by the world of video games. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at St. Lawrence College, Cornwall, Ontario.
        While I don't have professional game development experience, I'm incredibly curious and eager to learn.
        I don't really know how to program games, but I have a basic understanding of coding.
        However, I'll be learning how to program games in my College. I have a strong passion for gaming and spend a lot of time playing games.
        In the past, I used to primarily play the competitive game CS:GO.
        I can consider myself a semi-professional player as I have participated in various leagues and teams. 
        In the EU region, I reached a ranking of top 3500, but in the NA region, I'm in the top 200.
        Also I participated in a tournament Red Bull Flick2vs2 2022 which taked place in Copenhagen. 
        To participate in this event me and my teammate had to win a national tounnament in Kazakhstan.
